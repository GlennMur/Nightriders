<h1>
After balancing of the scores to the bowling alley web site, some adjustments:

John & Bernice had one round where the scores were reversed, the total pinfall adjusted by -50/50 respectively, no impact to team points
Bill had two of his scores incorrectly recorded as blinds in round 15, due to them being low scores (for Bill), some team points have changed in Kingpins favour
